  - Domains are now represented as top level projects with the attribute
    ``is_domain`` set to true. Such projects will appears as parents for any
    previous top level projects. Projects acting as domains can be created,
    read, update and deleted via either the project API or the domain API.
upgrade:
  - The contents of the sql domain table are migrated to the sql project
    table. Although the domain table (and its contents) are not removed in this
